## 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

### Authentication Flow
```
User opens app
    ↓
AppNavigator checks auth state
    ↓
├─ Not logged in → AuthStack
│   ├─ LoginScreen (default)
│   └─ SignupScreen
│
└─ Logged in → MainTabs
    └─ HomeScreen (+ room for more tabs)
```

### File Organization
```
Life_PA/
├── src/
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── firebase.js      [Firebase config]
│   │   └── auth.js          [Auth helpers]
│   ├── screens/
│   │   ├── LoginScreen.jsx  [Login UI]

│       └── AppNavigator.js  [Root + auth state]
└── App.js                   [Entry point]

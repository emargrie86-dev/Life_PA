### Setup Tests
- [ ] Firebase project created
- [ ] Email/Password authentication enabled in Firebase Console
- [ ] Firebase config updated in `src/services/firebase.js`
- [ ] App starts without errors (`npm start`)

### Authentication Flow Tests
- [ ] **Signup Flow:**
  - [ ] Navigate to Signup screen
  - [ ] Enter name, email, password
  - [ ] Validation works (weak password, mismatched passwords)
  - [ ] Successfully create account
  - [ ] Auto-redirect to Home screen

  - [ ] Successfully logout
  - [ ] Redirect to Login screen

### Navigation Tests

- [ ] Protected routes (can't access Home without login)
- [ ] Auth state persistence (close and reopen app)
- [ ] Loading states display correctly

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Keyboard dismisses properly
- [ ] Forms are scrollable
- [ ] Buttons show loading states

## üìù Test Instructions for User

### Step 1: Configure Firebase
Follow the instructions in `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### Step 2: Start the App
```bash
cd templateapp
npm start
```

### Step 3: Run Tests
Press `w` to open in web browser and run through the test checklist above.

### Step 4: Report Issues
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` troubleshooting section
2. Verify Firebase configuration is correct
3. Check console for error messages

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

### On First Launch (Not Logged In)
- App should display Login screen
- No errors in console
- UI should be clean and responsive

### After Signup
- User should be automatically logged in
- Home screen should display user's name and email
- Logout button should be visible

### After Login
- User should see Home screen
- User info should display correctly
- Navigation should work smoothly

### After Logout
- User should return to Login screen
- Cannot access Home screen without logging in
- Can log back in with same credentials

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- ‚úÖ Email/password authentication only (Google Sign-In not included)
- ‚úÖ Basic profile info only (name, email)
- ‚úÖ No password reset flow (can be added later)
- ‚úÖ No email verification (can be added later)
- ‚úÖ No profile photo upload (can be added later)

These are intentional limitations for the baseline Phase 2 implementation. All can be added as Phase 3+ enhancements.

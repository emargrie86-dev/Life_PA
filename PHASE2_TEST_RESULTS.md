## 📝 Test Instructions for User

### Step 1: Configure Firebase
Follow the instructions in `FIREBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### Step 2: Start the App
```bash
cd templateapp
npm start
```

### Step 3: Run Tests
Press `w` to open in web browser and run through the test checklist above.

### Step 4: Report Issues
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` troubleshooting section
2. Verify Firebase configuration is correct
3. Check console for error messages

---

## ✅ Expected Results

### On First Launch (Not Logged In)
- App should display Login screen
- No errors in console
- UI should be clean and responsive

### After Signup
- User should be automatically logged in
- Home screen should display user's name and email
- Logout button should be visible

### After Login
- User should see Home screen
- User info should display correctly
- Navigation should work smoothly

### After Logout
- User should return to Login screen
- Cannot access Home screen without logging in
- Can log back in with same credentials

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Email/password authentication only (Google Sign-In not included)
- ✅ Basic profile info only (name, email)
- ✅ No password reset flow (can be added later)
- ✅ No email verification (can be added later)
- ✅ No profile photo upload (can be added later)

These are intentional limitations for the baseline Phase 2 implementation. All can be added as Phase 3+ enhancements.

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### AI Tools (Function Calling)

Three new tools added to `aiTools.js`:

#### 1. create_habit
```javascript
{
  name: "create_habit",
  description: "Create a new habit for the user to track",
  parameters: {
    name: "string (required)",
    description: "string",
    cue: "string",
    routine: "string",
    reward: "string",
    frequency: "daily|weekly"
  }
}
```

**Example Usage:**
> User: "Help me build a habit to exercise daily"
> 
> AI: [Calls create_habit with structured data]

#### 2. log_habit_completion
```javascript
{
  name: "log_habit_completion",
  description: "Mark a habit as completed for today",
  parameters: {
    habit_name: "string (required)"
  }
}
```

**Example Usage:**
> User: "I just finished my morning run!"
> 
> AI: [Calls log_habit_completion("morning run")]

#### 3. view_habits
```javascript
{
  name: "view_habits",
  description: "View all habits and their progress",
  parameters: {}
}
```

**Example Usage:**
> User: "Show me my habits"
> 
> AI: [Calls view_habits and displays formatted list]

### Function Execution

Implemented in `functionExecutor.js`:

- `createHabitFromAI(params)` - Validates and creates habit
- `logHabitCompletionFromAI(params)` - Finds habit by name and logs completion
- `viewHabits()` - Formats and returns habit list

**Smart Features:**
- Fuzzy name matching for completion logging
- Automatic frequency detection
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## üí° The Habit Loop

Based on behavioral psychology research, the app follows the **Habit Loop** framework:

1. **Cue** - The trigger (time, location, emotion)
   - Example: "After morning coffee"

2. **Routine** - The behavior/action
   - Example: "Drink 500ml of water"

3. **Reward** - The benefit/feeling
   - Example: "Feel hydrated and energized"

4. **Track** - Monitor completion
   - Automatic via app

5. **Refine** - AI analyzes and optimizes
   - Weekly AI insights

This structure helps users build sustainable habits with clear triggers and rewards.

  allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  allow create: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
}

match /habit_completions/{completionId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Preconditions (do these first)
- Install Node.js (v16+)
- Install Expo CLI (optional): `npm install -g expo-cli` or use `npx create-expo-app`
- Expo SDK 51
- Create a free Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Open this repository in Cursor (editor mode)

---

## üèÅ How to use this plan in Cursor
1. Save this file as `docs/plan.md` in your project.  
2. Open `plan.md` in the editor (not the preview).  
3. Highlight the section you want to run (e.g., the entire **Phase 1: Setup** block).  
4. Press **Ctrl+I** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+I** (Mac) to open the Cursor AI panel.  
5. In the panel, click the action like ‚ÄúRun‚Äù or type: `Execute the highlighted plan and create the files described.`  
6. Cursor will scaffold files and boilerplate for that section.  
   - If right-click shows ‚ÄúRun Plan‚Äù, you can use that too.

## üìã Firebase Setup Reminder

Before running Phase 2, create a Firebase project:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create new project
3. Enable Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
4. Enable Firestore Database
5. Get your config and add to `src/services/firebase.js`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Start small:** Get Phase 1-2 baseline working, then build incrementally
- **Test frequently:** Run `npm start` (or `npx expo start`) after each phase
- **Use git branches:** Create a branch for each phase to track progress
- **Check logs:** Use `console.log` liberally during development
- **Expo Go app:** Install on your phone for real-device testing
- **API Keys:** Store OpenAI API key securely (never commit to git)
- **Permissions:** Test camera and notification permissions on real devices
- **Error handling:** Always handle API errors gracefully (OpenAI, Firestore, OCR)
- **Offline support:** Enable Firestore offline persistence for better UX
- **Budget awareness:** Monitor OpenAI API usage to control costs
- **OCR accuracy:** Test with various receipt types to tune OCR settings
- **Documentation:** Keep notes on customizations and configurations

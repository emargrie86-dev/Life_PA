# PDF Preview Fix ✅

**Issue:** Black/blank screen when loading PDF files  
**Cause:** PDF files cannot be displayed in React Native `<Image>` component  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 The Problem

When users selected a PDF file:
- ✅ File was loaded successfully 
- ✅ "Process Receipt" button appeared
- ❌ Preview area showed completely black screen
- ❌ No indication of what was loaded

**Root Cause:**  
PDF files have a URI but can't be rendered by the `<Image>` component. The component was trying to display the PDF as an image, resulting in a black/blank display area.

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Track File Type**
   - Added `capturedFileType` state to track whether it's an image or PDF
   - Set to `'image'` for photos and image files
   - Set to `'pdf'` for PDF documents

2. **Conditional Preview Rendering**
   - **For Images:** Display using `<Image>` component (works as before)
   - **For PDFs:** Show informative placeholder with icon and text

3. **PDF Placeholder UI**
   - Large PDF icon (📄)
   - "PDF Document Loaded" title
   - Explanation: "PDF preview not available in browser"
   - Instructions: "Click 'Process Receipt' to extract text"
   - Warning: "⚠️ OCR accuracy may vary with PDF files"

## 💡 Why Not Full PDF Preview?

### Technical Reasons:
1. **Web Limitations:** React Native Image component doesn't support PDFs
2. **Browser Restrictions:** Different browsers handle PDFs differently
3. **Performance:** PDF rendering requires heavy libraries
4. **Complexity:** Would need PDF.js or similar library

### Our Approach:
- **Pragmatic:** Show clear information instead of trying to render
- **Honest:** Tell users preview isn't available
- **Functional:** OCR still works on PDF files
- **User-Friendly:** Clear instructions on what to do

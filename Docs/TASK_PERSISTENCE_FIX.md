# Task Persistence Fix

## Issue
Tasks deleted from the ViewTasksScreen were reappearing when navigating away and back to the screen.

## Root Cause
The tasks were stored in local component state and initialized from mock data on every component mount. When tasks were deleted, only the component state was updated, not any persistent storage. This meant that navigating away and back would re-initialize the state with the original mock data.

## Solution
Implemented a persistent task storage solution using AsyncStorage:

### 1. Created Task Service (`src/services/taskService.js`)
- **Storage**: Uses `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for local persistent storage
- **Functions**:
  - `getTasks()` - Retrieves all tasks from storage
  - `addTask(task)` - Adds a new task and persists it
  - `updateTask(taskId, updates)` - Updates an existing task
  - `toggleTaskCompletion(taskId)` - Toggles task completion status
  - `deleteTask(taskId)` - Deletes a task permanently
  - `resetTasks()` - Resets to initial mock data (for testing)
  - `clearAllTasks()` - Clears all tasks (for testing)

### 2. Updated ViewTasksScreen (`src/screens/ViewTasksScreen.jsx`)
- **Added imports**: `useEffect`, `ActivityIndicator`, and task service functions
- **State management**: 
  - Added `loading` state to show loading indicator
  - Removed hardcoded mock data initialization
- **Data loading**:
  - `useEffect` hook loads tasks when component mounts
  - Navigation listener reloads tasks when screen comes into focus
- **Async operations**:
  - `handleDeleteTask()` now calls `deleteTask()` service and updates local state
  - `handleToggleComplete()` now calls `toggleTaskCompletion()` service and updates local state
- **UI improvements**: Added loading indicator while tasks are being loaded

### 3. Updated SetReminderScreen (`src/screens/SetReminderScreen.jsx`)
- **Added import**: `addTask` from task service
- **Implemented save functionality**:
  - Combined date and time inputs into a single DateTime
  - Calls `addTask()` service to persist the new reminder
  - Shows success/error alerts based on operation result

### 4. Updated AddEventScreen (`src/screens/AddEventScreen.jsx`)
- **Added import**: `addTask` from task service
- **Implemented save functionality**:
  - Saves events as tasks with start date as due date
  - Appends location to description if provided
  - Sets default priority to 'medium' for events
  - Calls `addTask()` service to persist the new event
  - Shows success/error alerts based on operation result

### 5. Updated HomeScreen (`src/screens/HomeScreen.jsx`)
- **Removed mock data**: Deleted hardcoded test events
- **Integrated with task service**:
  - Loads real tasks from storage
  - Displays up to 4 upcoming incomplete tasks
  - Auto-refreshes when screen comes into focus
  - Shows formatted dates (Today, Tomorrow, etc.)
  - "View All" button navigates to ViewTasks screen

## Data Schema
Tasks are stored as an array of objects with the following structure:
```javascript
{
  id: string,              // Unique identifier (timestamp-based)
  title: string,           // Task title
  description: string,     // Task description
  dueDate: Date,           // Due date and time
  categoryId: string,      // Category ID (work, shopping, health, etc.)
  priority: string,        // Priority level (high, medium, low)
  isCompleted: boolean,    // Completion status
  isRecurring: boolean     // Whether task is recurring (optional)
}
```

## Technical Details
- **Storage Key**: `@life_pa_tasks`
- **Date Handling**: Dates are converted to ISO strings for storage and parsed back to Date objects on retrieval
- **Initialization**: On first run, the app initializes with 5 mock tasks
- **Persistence**: All changes (add, update, delete, toggle) are immediately persisted to AsyncStorage

## Benefits
1. ✅ Tasks persist across app sessions
2. ✅ Deletions are permanent (until user creates new tasks)
3. ✅ Works offline (no backend required)
4. ✅ Fast read/write operations
5. ✅ Seamless navigation experience

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the app and navigate to View Tasks
2. Delete one or more tasks
3. Navigate away (to Home or another screen)
4. Navigate back to View Tasks
5. ✅ Verify deleted tasks do NOT reappear
6. Create a new reminder from Set Reminder screen
7. ✅ Verify it appears in View Tasks
8. Create a new event from Add Event screen
9. ✅ Verify it appears in View Tasks and on Home page
10. Toggle task completion status
11. ✅ Verify completion status persists
12. Close and reopen the app
13. ✅ Verify all changes persist across app sessions
14. Navigate to Home screen
15. ✅ Verify upcoming tasks are displayed (max 4)
16. ✅ Verify "View All" button navigates to View Tasks

## Future Enhancements
- Migrate to Firestore for cloud sync across devices
- Add undo functionality for deletions
- Implement task archiving instead of permanent deletion
- Add task search and advanced filtering
- Implement task sorting (by date, priority, category)

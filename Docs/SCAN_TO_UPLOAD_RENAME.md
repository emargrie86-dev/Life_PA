- No breaking changes for existing conversations

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Navigation:

- ✅ Receipts → Upload New Document button works
- ✅ Chat → AI tool triggers upload
- ✅ All screens show "Upload Document" title

### Functionality:
- ✅ Camera still works (native)
- ✅ Gallery picker works
- ✅ Document upload works
- ✅ Process Document button works
- ✅ Navigation back works

### AI Integration:
- ✅ Chat command: "Upload a document" → triggers upload
- ✅ Chat command: "Scan receipt" (old) → still works
- ✅ Tool execution successful
- ✅ Navigation triggered correctly

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/navigation/MainTabs.js`
2. ✅ `src/screens/HomeScreen.jsx`
3. ✅ `src/screens/ReceiptsListScreen.jsx`
4. ✅ `src/screens/ScanReceiptScreen.jsx`
5. ✅ `src/screens/ReceiptDetailScreen.jsx`

## 🎯 What Stays the Same

### No Changes To:
- ✅ File names (ScanReceiptScreen.jsx kept for code organization)
- ✅ Component names (export default ScanReceiptScreen)
- ✅ Functionality (camera, gallery, document picker)
- ✅ Receipt data structure
- ✅ Firebase collections
- ✅ OCR processing
- ✅ AI parsing

### Why?
- Internal code structure doesn't need to match UI labels
- Avoids breaking imports and references
- Maintains consistency with Firebase schema
- Easier for developers (less refactoring)

## 🚀 User Experience

### Before:
"Scan Receipt" → Implied camera only

### After:
"Upload Document" → Suggests multiple input methods
- 📸 Camera (mobile)
- 🖼️ Gallery
- 📄 Document picker

### Benefits:
- ✅ More accurate description
- ✅ Clearer functionality
- ✅ Better user expectations
- ✅ Emphasizes flexibility

## 💡 Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements:
- Rename file: `ScanReceiptScreen.jsx` → `UploadDocumentScreen.jsx`
- Update component export name
- Consolidate documentation references
- Update any remaining comments

### Not Urgent:
- Internal naming is fine
- No user-facing impact
- Can be done in future refactor

# Scan Receipt Screen - Web Compatibility Fix ✅

**Issue:** Blank screen when clicking "Scan Receipt"  
**Cause:** `expo-camera` Camera component not compatible with web platform  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem

The ScanReceiptScreen was showing a blank page because:
- `expo-camera`'s Camera component doesn't work on web
- The import was causing the entire component to fail to render
- No proper handling for web platform differences

---

## ✅ Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Conditional Camera Import**
   - Camera module now imported conditionally only on native platforms
   - Uses `require()` instead of `import` for dynamic loading
   - Prevents module errors on web

2. **Web Platform Handling**
   - Set permission state to `'web'` on web platform
   - Hide camera button on web (only show Gallery and Document)
   - Updated instructions for web users

3. **UI Adaptation**
   - Camera button hidden on web
   - Instructions updated for web vs mobile
   - Gallery and Document upload fully functional on web

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```javascript
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';
// This would fail on web, causing blank screen
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
// Conditionally import Camera only on native platforms
let Camera, CameraType;
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  try {
    const cameraModule = require('expo-camera');
    Camera = cameraModule.Camera;
    CameraType = cameraModule.CameraType;
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('expo-camera not available:', error);
  }
}
```

### Permission Handling Update
```javascript
const requestPermissions = async () => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
    // On web, camera is not available but gallery/document upload works
    setHasPermission('web'); // Special value to indicate web mode
    return;
  }
  
  // Native platform permission handling...
};
```

### UI Conditional Rendering
```javascript
{Platform.OS !== 'web' && Camera && (
  <TouchableOpacity
    style={styles.captureButton}
    onPress={handleTakePhoto}
  >
    <View style={styles.captureButtonInner} />
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Platform-Specific Module Loading
- Not all Expo modules work on web
- Use conditional imports for native-only modules
- Check `Platform.OS` before using native features

### Error Handling
- Always wrap native module imports in try-catch
- Provide fallbacks for unavailable features
- Give clear feedback to users about limitations

### User Experience
- Hide unavailable features rather than showing errors
- Update instructions based on platform
- Provide alternative methods (gallery/document upload)

---

## 🔍 Debug Tips

If blank screen appears:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Camera is not imported on web
3. Check that `hasPermission` is set properly
4. Ensure Layout and AppHeader components work
5. Test with simple text render first

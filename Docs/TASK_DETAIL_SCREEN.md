# 📋 Task Detail Screen Implementation

## ✅ Complete!

Successfully created a dedicated Task Detail Screen that opens when clicking on events/reminders from the homepage, similar to how clicking documents opens the Document Detail Screen!

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **TaskDetailScreen.jsx** (New Screen)
A full-featured detail view for tasks, events, and reminders with:
- ✅ View all task details (title, description, location, date/time, category)
- ✅ Edit mode to modify task information
- ✅ Toggle task completion status
- ✅ Delete tasks with confirmation
- ✅ Date & time pickers for editing
- ✅ Category selection with visual chips
- ✅ All-day event toggle
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Toast notifications for actions

### 2. **getTask Function** (taskService.js)
Added a new service function to fetch individual tasks:
```javascript
export const getTask = async (taskId) => {
  // Searches in both 'events' and 'reminders' collections
  // Returns the task with its type (event or reminder)
}
```

### 3. **Navigation Integration**
- ✅ Added `TaskDetailScreen` to `MainTabs.js`
- ✅ Created route: `TaskDetail`
- ✅ Updated `HomeScreen` to navigate to `TaskDetail` on event click

## 📱 How It Works

### Before:
- Click event → Shows alert popup with basic info ❌

### After:
- Click event → Opens full TaskDetailScreen! ✅
- Click document → Opens DocumentDetailScreen! ✅

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User clicks event on homepage
2. Navigate to `TaskDetail` with `taskId` parameter
3. Call `getTask(taskId)` to fetch from Firestore
4. Display data in view mode
5. Allow editing and saving back to Firestore

### Firestore Integration
```javascript
// Fetches from both collections
- events collection (for events)
- reminders collection (for reminders)

// Handles both document types seamlessly
```

### Fields Supported
- `title` - Required
- `description` - Optional
- `location` - Optional (events)
- `dueDate` / `datetime` - Date/time
- `categoryId` - Category reference
- `isAllDay` - Boolean
- `isCompleted` - Boolean
- `type` - 'event' or 'reminder'

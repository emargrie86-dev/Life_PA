## 💡 Use Cases

### When to Use Document Upload

✅ **Digital receipts** received via email  
✅ **Scanned documents** on device  
✅ **PDF invoices** from downloads  
✅ **Screenshots** of receipts

### Example Scenarios

- User has receipt screenshot in downloads
- User wants to upload multiple old receipts
- User has scanned documents to process

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### PDF Support

While PDFs are supported, OCR accuracy may vary:
- **Best results**: Convert PDF to image first
- **Native PDFs**: May have text extraction issues
- **Scanned PDFs**: Work similarly to images
- **User is notified**: Confirmation dialog explains limitations

### File Size Considerations

- Documents are copied to cache directory
- Files are compressed before upload to Firebase
- Large files may take longer to process
- Network bandwidth affects upload speed

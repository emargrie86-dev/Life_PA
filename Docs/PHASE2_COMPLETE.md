## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Configure Firebase

Before you can use authentication, you need to set up Firebase:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or use existing)
3. Enable Authentication:
   - Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable "Email/Password"
4. Get your configuration:
   - Go to Project Settings > Your apps
   - Click "Web app" and copy the config

5. **Update `src/services/firebase.js`** with your config:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 2. Start the App

```bash
cd Life_PA
npm start
```

### 3. Test the App

1. **Sign Up Flow:**
   - Open the app (will show Login screen)
   - Tap "Sign Up"
   - Enter name, email, password
   - Tap "Create Account"
   - You'll be automatically logged in

2. **Login Flow:**
   - Use your email/password to sign in
   - Tap "Sign In"
   - You'll see the Home screen

3. **Logout:**
   - From Home screen, tap "Logout"
   - Confirm the logout
   - You'll return to Login screen

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Authentication Flow

```
App.js
  └─ AppNavigator (checks auth state)
       ├─ User NOT logged in → AuthStack
       │    ├─ LoginScreen
       │    └─ SignupScreen
       │
       └─ User logged in → MainTabs
            └─ HomeScreen (+ future tabs)
```

### Auth State Management

The app uses Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener in `AppNavigator.js`:
- Automatically detects when user logs in/out
- Switches between AuthStack and MainTabs
- Shows loading screen during auth check
- No manual navigation needed

### Service Pattern

**`firebase.js`** - Initializes Firebase services (one-time setup)  
**`auth.js`** - Provides reusable auth functions:
- `signUpWithEmail(email, password, name)`
- `signInWithEmail(email, password)`
- `signOutUser()`
- `getCurrentUser()`
- `subscribeToAuthChanges(callback)`

This pattern keeps your screens clean and logic reusable.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before moving to Phase 3, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Create a new account with valid credentials
- [ ] Try creating account with invalid email
- [ ] Try creating account with weak password (< 6 chars)
- [ ] Try creating account with mismatched passwords
- [ ] Login with correct credentials
- [ ] Try logging in with wrong password
- [ ] Try logging in with non-existent email
- [ ] Verify user info displays on Home screen
- [ ] Logout and verify return to Login screen
- [ ] Close app and reopen (should remember login state)
- [ ] Test on web browser (if using web)
- [ ] Test on Android/iOS device or simulator

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Current Implementation
- Passwords are securely handled by Firebase Authentication
- All auth requests use HTTPS
- User sessions are managed by Firebase
- Auth state persists across app restarts

### Firebase Security Rules (Recommended)
When you add Firestore in later phases, set up security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only authenticated users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Add More Auth Methods
- Google Sign-In
- Apple Sign-In
- Phone authentication
- Anonymous auth

### Enhance UI
- Add app logo to Login/Signup screens
- Implement password strength indicator
- Add "Remember me" option
- Create password reset flow
- Add email verification

### Improve Navigation
- Add more tabs to MainTabs
- Create nested navigators
- Add drawer navigation
- Implement deep linking

---

## 📝 Code Examples

### Using Auth in Any Component

```javascript
import { getCurrentUser, signOutUser } from '../services/auth';

function MyComponent() {
  const user = getCurrentUser();
  
  const handleLogout = async () => {
    await signOutUser();
  };
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, {user?.displayName}</Text>
      <Button title="Logout" onPress={handleLogout} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Protecting Data by User ID

```javascript
import { getCurrentUser } from '../services/auth';
import { db } from '../services/firebase';
import { collection, query, where, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';

async function getUserData() {
  const user = getCurrentUser();
  if (!user) return [];
  
  const q = query(
    collection(db, 'items'),
    where('userId', '==', user.uid)
  );
  
  const snapshot = await getDocs(q);
  return snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }));
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)"
**Solution:** You haven't replaced the placeholder Firebase config yet. Update `src/services/firebase.js` with your actual Firebase credentials.

### "Unable to resolve module @react-navigation/native"
**Solution:** Make sure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
cd Life_PA
npm install
```

### "Network request failed"
**Solution:** 
- Check your internet connection
- For development on physical device, ensure device and computer are on same network
- Try running: `npm start --tunnel`

### App crashes on startup
**Solution:**
- Clear cache: `npm start --clear`
- Reinstall node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check console for error messages

### Firebase errors in development
**Solution:** If you see SSL/TLS warnings, check your package.json scripts have the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` flag (already configured in this template).

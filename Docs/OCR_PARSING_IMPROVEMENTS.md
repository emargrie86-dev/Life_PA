# OCR Parsing Improvements ✅

**Issues Fixed:** Currency symbols, amount extraction, merchant name extraction  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### 1. Wrong Currency Symbols
- **Problem:** Showing "$" for all amounts regardless of actual currency
- **Example:** British Gas bill in £ (GBP) showing as "$0.00"

### 2. Amount Not Extracted
- **Problem:** Total amount showing as $0.00 instead of £61.91
- **Cause:** Parsing pattern didn't match "Total amount now due: £61.91"

### 3. Merchant Name Garbled  
- **Problem:** Showing "ag a VAT registration number 000 0000 00"
- **Should be:** "British Gas"

### 4. Missing Save Button
- **Issue:** User couldn't see how to save after editing
- **Reality:** Button was there, but only appears after clicking "Edit"

---

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Currency Symbols

**Added currency symbol mapping:**
```javascript
const getCurrencySymbol = (currencyCode) => {
  const symbols = {
    'USD': '$',
    'EUR': '€',
    'GBP': '£',   // ← Now shows £ for British pounds
    'CAD': 'C$',
    'AUD': 'A$',
    'JPY': '¥',
    'CNY': '¥',
    'INR': '₹',
  };
  return symbols[currencyCode] || currencyCode || '$';
};
```

**Now displays:**
- GBP receipts: £61.91 ✅
- USD receipts: $61.91 ✅
- EUR receipts: €61.91 ✅

---

### 2. Improved Amount Extraction

**Added better patterns to match:**
- "Total amount now due: £61.91"
- "Amount due: 61.91"
- "Total: £61.91"
- "£61.91" (standalone)

**New extraction logic:**
```javascript
const patterns = [
  // "total amount now due" with currency symbols
  /(?:total[\s\w]*(?:amount|due|payable))[\s:£$€]*(\d+[.,]\d{2})/i,
  // "£XX.XX" or "$XX.XX"
  /[£$€]\s*(\d+[.,]\d{2})/g,
  // More patterns...
];
```

**Finds the highest amount** (usually the total)

---

### 3. Better Merchant Name Extraction

**Skips:**
- VAT registration numbers
- Address lines
- "Looking after your world" taglines
- PLC, LTD, Limited
- Head Office addresses

**Extracts:**
- Clean merchant name
- Removes special characters
- Limits to 50 characters

**Example Results:**
- ✅ "British Gas" (not "ag a VAT registration...")
- ✅ "Tesco" (not "Tesco PLC 123 Street...")
- ✅ "Starbucks" (not "Starbucks Coffee Company Ltd...")

---

### 4. Save Button Clarification

**How it works:**
1. Receipt loads → Shows "Edit" and "Delete" buttons
2. Click **"Edit"** → Changes to "Cancel" and **"Save Changes"** buttons
3. Make your edits
4. Click **"Save Changes"** → Updates receipt and exits edit mode

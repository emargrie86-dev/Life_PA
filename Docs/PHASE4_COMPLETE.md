## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### AI Service Layer
```
aiService.js (Unified interface)
    ├── openai.js (OpenAI provider)
    ├── huggingface.js (HF provider)
    └── cohere.js (Cohere provider)
```

Each provider implements:
- API key storage (AsyncStorage)
- Client initialization
- Message sending
- Tool/function calling (where supported)
- Error handling

### Tool Execution Flow
1. User sends message
2. AI analyzes and decides to use tools
3. `functionExecutor.js` executes requested tools
4. Results sent back to chat
5. Success/failure displayed to user
6. Side effects (navigation, data creation) executed

### Data Schema (Firestore)
```javascript
// Collection: 'conversations'
{
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  title: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  messages: [
    {
      id: string,
      role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system',
      content: string,
      timestamp: Timestamp
    }
  ]
}
```

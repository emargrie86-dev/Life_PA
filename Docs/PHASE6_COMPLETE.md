## 📚 Code Examples

### Scan a Receipt
```javascript
// In any screen
navigation.navigate('ScanReceipt');
```

### View Receipt List
```javascript
navigation.navigate('ReceiptsList');
```

### Access Receipt Services
```javascript
import { getUserReceipts, createReceipt } from '../services/receiptService';

// Get user's receipts
const receipts = await getUserReceipts(userId);

// Create new receipt
const receiptId = await createReceipt({
  userId,
  merchantName: 'Starbucks',
  totalAmount: 5.99,
  category: 'Dining',
  // ... other fields
});
```

### Use OCR Service
```javascript
import { extractTextFromImage } from '../services/ocrService';

// Extract text from image
const text = await extractTextFromImage(imageUri);
```

### Parse Receipt Text
```javascript
import { parseReceiptText } from '../utils/textParsing';

// Parse extracted text
const parsedData = parseReceiptText(extractedText);
// Returns: { merchantName, date, totalAmount, currency, category, items }
```

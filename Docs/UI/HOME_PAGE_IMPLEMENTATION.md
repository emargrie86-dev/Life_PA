- Education, Family, Travel, Hobby, Shopping
- Home, Entertainment, Appointments, Other

Each category includes:
- Unique ID
- Display name

## Mock Data Structure

Currently using sample events for display. Event structure:
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  date: string,      // e.g., "Today", "Tomorrow", "Saturday"
  time: string,      // e.g., "2:00 PM"
  categoryId: string, // e.g., "work", "personal", "social"
}
```

Categories are retrieved using:
```javascript
import { getCategoryById } from '../theme/categories';
const category = getCategoryById(event.categoryId);
// Returns: { id, name, color, icon }
```

**Sample Events:**
- Team Meeting (Work) - Today at 2:00 PM
- Dentist Appointment (Appointments) - Tomorrow at 10:30 AM
- Birthday Party (Social) - Saturday at 6:00 PM
- Gym Session (Health) - Sunday at 8:00 AM

  - Partially addressed (HomeScreen, UploadDocumentScreen reduced)
  - Consider further breakdown in Week 4
  
- **Issue #11:** Firestore Query Optimization
  - Indexes documented
  - Need to create indexes in Firebase Console before production

### Very Low Priority
- PropTypes/TypeScript migration
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Additional performance optimizations

---

## Rollback Strategy

Each week's changes are self-contained and can be reverted independently:

### Week 1 Rollback
```bash
# Revert to hardcoded config (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git revert <week1-commit-hash>
```

### Week 2 Rollback
```bash
# Revert utilities (will lose error handling improvements)
git revert <week2-commit-hash>
```

### Week 3 Rollback
```bash
# Revert component extraction (will increase file sizes)
git revert <week3-commit-hash>
```

**Note:** Rollback not recommended. All changes have been tested and improve code quality.
